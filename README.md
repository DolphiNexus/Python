# Python Taco Challenge
To run the project successfully I used a class called order and used variables to run the project successfully. I had a lot of trouble with this project but I was able to complete it. I feel that there is more that I can add to the code to make it more interesting!

# How does it work?
The process is very simple, I will go over it below:
```
class Order():
    def __init__(self,meat,topping):
        self.meat = meat
        self.topping = topping
```
* self.meat and self.topping are identifiers when the users actually inputs their order. This tells what to input when the order summary is printed out.
```
print('Welcome to the Taco Shop! May I take your order?')
print('Ok! Your taco will contain '+meat,'and '+topping,'!')
```
* This prints out what I want the code to say before and after the user inputs their favorite taco topping and meat. 
* The second print is different, the +meat and +topping is inputing the user's input into the order summary.

# Conclusion
This challenge took some time but it was simple once you get a better understanding on how to use Python.
